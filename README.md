# Marine Phanerozoic biodiversity increases in presence of ecosystem engineers

<i><b> THIS README IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION </i></b>

## Datasets
There are two .RData files in <kbd>[Data](https://github.com/atcribb/Ecosystem-Engineers-Biodiversity/tree/main/Data)</kbd>:
* ``Bioturbators_data.RData`` - contains the bioturbator ecosystem engineering data
* ``Reef_Ecosystem_Engineers_Final.RData`` - contains the reef-builder ecosystem engineering data

Analyases are not done on these two datasets perse, but they are needed in order to come up with the lists of formations that do and do not contain ecosystem engineers in the <b>Analyses</b> Effect Size scripts.
