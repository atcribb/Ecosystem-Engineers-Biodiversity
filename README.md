* Data Cleaning
To prepare the PBDB data, use the files in the DataClean folder:
1. Use the cleaning and binning functions to clean up the raw pbdb data to create your own Phanerozoic_marine_cleaned_binned.RData
2. Use the formation_cleaning.R and formation_cleaning.csv files to fix formation issues (see manuscript text for details) and create a Phanerozoic_marine_final.RData
